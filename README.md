<H1 style="text-align: center">  About This Project </H1>

This is a guided project I am Making to learn web development skill. This shall be a clone of ChatGPT and Shall work in online mode. This is the first time I shall be making a real website and Hosting it using GitHub's free domain. **This is my first website and I shall host it too**  :smile:

The Things I think I am going to learn from this project are listed in [Learnings](#learnings). And the reason for selecting this as a project is in the [Why](#why) section.
The Source of learning is given in the [Refercnce](#refercnce). I have already learnd all the concepts of python form same source and time to make a real project.

## :open_file_folder: Files

All the images and other related things are in ***Files*** folder. This folder is for storing the requirements for the website.<br>

<!-- Something about the files of the Project here -->

<!-- The Game code and logic is in the file **[game.py](./game.py)** <br>
Where as the main file is which contains all the preplaying setup and other stuff are in **[main.py](./main.py)** -->

## :student: Why
The Major reason of selecting this as project is Learn how the website is made and it works. My main focus is to learn as much as I can and I feel like makin projects is the best way to do so. I have selected the ChatGPT clone as this is too much hyped and ternding these days. And its API is also easisly avilable.


## :writing_hand: Learnings
These is going to be a great learning process as there are many small project that I have done but this is the first time I am making a web porject. <br>
I am looking forward to use all the things that I have learned in this journey and making something that would atleast help me. Although it might not be ground breaking but would be helpful for me I could use it to seek help form the ChatGPT via my own version of it.<br>
This is going to involve the use of many modules that I hardly heard of. That is going to give me exposure to many new things.
